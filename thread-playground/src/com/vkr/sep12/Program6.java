//What is ThreadPool in Java?
//
//A thread pool reuses previously created threads to execute current tasks and offers 
//a solution to the problem of thread cycle overhead and resource thrashing. 
//Since the thread is already existing when the request arrives, 
//the delay introduced by thread creation is eliminated, making the application more responsive.
//
//
//
//
//Java provides the Executor framework which is centered around the Executor interface, 
//its sub-interface â€“ExecutorService and the class-ThreadPoolExecutor, which implements both of these interfaces. 
//By using the executor, one only has to implement the Runnable objects and send them to the executor to execute.
//They allow you to take advantage of threading, but focus on the tasks that you want the thread to perform, 
//instead of thread mechanics.
//To use thread pools, we first create a object of ExecutorService and pass a set of tasks to it. 
//ThreadPoolExecutor class allows to set the core and maximum pool size.
//The runnables that are run by a particular thread are executed sequentially.
